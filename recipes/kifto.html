  <p>
    Kifto is a traditional Ethiopian dish made with minced raw or lightly cooked beef, 
    mixed with spiced clarified butter (niter kibbeh) and seasoned with mitmita, 
    a flavorful chili powder. It's a delicacy often served with injera or kocho, 
    complemented by ayib, an Ethiopian cottage cheese.
